### Overview
* We learned in class the idea of one vs. rest as one of the two ways to implement a multiclass classifier. Derived one-to-many perceptron class from scikit-learn one-to-one class, using basic ML principles.
* Split data into training-validation-test sets using scikit learn train_test_split function
* Used Matplot to graph relevant data
* Constructed and interpreted confusion matrix and classification report
